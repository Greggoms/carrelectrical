      "We had Carr Electrical Systems do work in at least 5 of our rooms at our condo in Hot Springs. There was some high and very small spaces they had to work with but they did a great job. Everything was done professionally, on time and they cleaned up after themselves. They were very nice and explained everything they had to be done to accomplish what I wanted. They were very reasonably price compared to other companies we check with. We will be using them again for some other jobs in the future.",
